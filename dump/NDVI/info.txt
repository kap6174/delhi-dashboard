NDVI 
NDVI, or Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, is a remote sensing indicator that quantifies the amount and health of live green vegetation by analyzing the different ways plants reflect visible and near-infrared light. Sentinel-2 is a wide-swath, high-resolution, multi-spectral imaging mission supporting Copernicus Land Monitoring studies, including the monitoring of vegetation, soil and water cover, as well as observation of inland waterways and coastal areas.

Map dataset returning zero images for winter and monsoon. Likely weather conditions are the reason.
There are two types of maps - vis for visualisation and raw. Raw contain the mask (hopefully) so you only have to see vis.
There are stark differences between two adjacent years. Their cause is unknown, I think its dataset problem.

Map's color coding : 
Color			NDVI Range	Meaning				Typical Surface
Red (#d73027)		< 0.2		Barren / built-up / dry soil	Urban, concrete, bare land
Yellow (#fee08b)	0.2â€“0.5		Moderate vegetation		Grassland, cropland, shrubs
Green (#1a9850)		> 0.5		Dense vegetation		Forest, parks, tree cover
